## What this course is about 

CS 9 serves as a continuation of material covered in _CS 8: Introduction to Computer Science_ using the Python programming language. The target of this class is for non-CS majors who will learn additional fundamental CS topics such as object-oriented programming, algorithm runtime analysis, fundamental data structures, and testing methodologies. By the end of this course, students should be able to explain tradeoffs between various algorithms / data structures, their performance, and their implementation. 

## A few course policies in brief

* If you are registered for another UCSB course that overlaps with this one, you are responsible for any work or material you may miss. You will not get credit on any work you miss as a result, and we WILL NOT make accommodations.
* Collaboration is only permitted when specifically allowed for â€” otherwise, you must do your own work independently (lab assignments must be done independently this quarter).
* I recognize that some absences (e.g., minor illnesses, mishaps, etc.) are unavoidable. Litigating whether each of these is "excused" or not isn't a good use of anyone's time, so instead we will drop the lowest two grades from everyone's homework. No lab assignments will be dropped. This way, absences (or failure to submit homework) does not unduly penalize your grade unless it becomes excessive.
* We will use the [Gradescope system]({{ site.gradescope_url }}) this quarter for lab submissions and homework assignments. The midterm and final exams will be conducted in-person.
* All regrade requests must be made on Gradescope and we will not consider a regrade request one week after the assignment grades are distributed back to students.

## Course Philosophy

Learning the details of programming requires <strong>A LOT OF PRACTICE</strong>, like learning any new skill. Making mistakes is an essential part of learning as long as you learn from them! Questions like "I wonder what will happen if I do this..." or "How will Python behave in this case..." is a great way to investigate and observe the functionality and limitations of a programming language (there are many programming languages available to software developers and each have their specific pros and cons that may or may not be the best choice for the problems you are trying to solve).

One of the best way to practice is to <strong>rapid prototype</strong> constantly. Writing simple snippets of code to test and confirm your understanding allows you to 1) practice typing out code, which makes you more comfortable with the language and 2) solidify your understanding of the specific behavior of the programming language functionality.

We highly encourage all students to start all assignments and reading **as early as possible**, and invite all students to seek assistance **during our lab sections / office hours when offered.** Waiting until the last-minute to ask questions or provide clarifications may result in not receiving a response in time - please give us ample time to help you appropriately.
